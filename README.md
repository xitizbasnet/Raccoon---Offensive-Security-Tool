 Raccoon - Offensive Security Tool

A raccoon is a tool made for reconnaissance and information gathering with an emphasis on simplicity.

How it works :footprints:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
It does everything from fetching DNS records, retrieving WHOIS information, obtaining TLS data, detecting WAF presence and up to threaded dir busting and subdomain enumeration. Every scan outputs to a corresponding file.

Raccoon scans :footprints:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
As most of Raccoon scans are independent and do not rely on each other's results, it utilizes Python's asyncio to run most scans asynchronously.

anonymous routing :footprints:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Raccoon supports Tor/proxy for anonymous routing.
